# stl2png
A quick python script that uses OpenSCAD to convert an stl to a png. You will need OpenSCAD installed of course. Depending on where you have it installed you will have to modify the script.

The script will need a directory containing stl files that it will walk as the first argument. The second argument is the directory where you want the pngs to go.

Each stl file will generate 4 pngs, rotated a bit so can get a decent look at what the stl file represents.
